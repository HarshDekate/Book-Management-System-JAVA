Note: After refactoring, a new class named "HoldRequestOperations" has been added to remove bidirectional dependencies between `HoldRequest` and `Book` classes. For more details, refer to the [Refactoring Details](#refactoring-details) section below.

## Database Schema

The database schema of the project is provided in the `database_schema.sql` file. You can use this schema to set up the database for the system.

## Refactoring Details

After refactoring, the new `HoldRequestOperations` class has been added to the project structure. This class sits between the `HoldRequest` and `Book` classes, eliminating the bidirectional dependency between them. This enhances the modularity and maintainability of the system.
